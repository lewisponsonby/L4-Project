Chelsea looked unrecognisable at the back. I think there were too many changes. It counts against you in this situation because you are trying to formulate partnership and it's always changing at the back. It was a different back three today.

They are wing-backs that aren't wing-backs. They played Raheem Sterling in a wing-back position today and I don't think it suited in the way they played. Maybe Graham Potter was trying to be too clever. Keep it the same and football is a simple game.

Newcastle boss Eddie Howe, speaking to Sky Sports: "The lads really competed well. It was a bity first half, very stop-start. Thankfully in the second half we were outstanding. That is up there with one of the best performances of the season.

"I'm really pleased for Callum [Wilson]. Penalties are never easy but he put it away well. He was at the heart of a lot of our good football.

"It was an outstanding finish by Miguel [Almiron]. We hope the Aston Villa keeper is OK. It didn't help the game. Thankfully in the second half we were able to express ourselves better.

"Tonight I hope fans all enjoy themselves. We're already looking forward to next week."
