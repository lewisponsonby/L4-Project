<a href="#par2" id="par2">¶</a>2.  BROTHER KING HUSSEIN IBN TALAL, KING OF THE 
FRATERNAL HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN: ON BEHALF OF 
YOUR LIBYAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO ARE STRUGGLING 
AGAINST THE UNJUST BIG POWERS, AND IN MY OWN NAME, I 
GREET YOU AND THE MINISTERS OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 
HEALTH, AND INFORMATION IN THE FRATERNAL HASHEMITE 
KINGDOM OF JORDAN FOR YOUR FIRM STAND AGAINST THE 
STATE TERRORISM AND REPEATED AGGRESSION AGAINST 
AL-RABITAH VILLAGE AND KHALIJ AL-BUMBAH AFTER THE 
GULF OF SIDRA.  THE AGGRESSION WAS DEFEATED THANKS TO 
THE ARAB NATION'S UNIFIED STAND.  THE FLEETS 
RETREATED NOT BECAUSE OF AN EQUIVALENT LIBYAN 
MILITARY FORCE, BUT BECAUSE OF AN INTERNATIONAL STAND 
STEMMING FROM THE UNITY OF THE ARAB STAND.  YOU HAVE 
ADDED AN IMMORTAL AND SHINING EXAMPLE TO OUR ARAB 
NATION'S CONTEMPORARY HISTORY.  THIS EXAMPLE WOULD 
NOT HAVE BEEN SET BY ONE HAND ONLY, BUT WAS SET BY 
THE HANDS OF ALL OF YOU, BECAUSE THIS IS AN HONOR TO 
ALL OF YOU.  YOU HAVE RETURNED TO THE ARAB NATION ITS 
PRESTIGE AND SOVEREIGNTY BEFORE THE WORLD, THANKS TO 
THIS UNFORGETTABLE UNIFIED STAND.  I HOPE WE WILL 
PLEDGE AS FROM NOW TO ACHIEVE THE ARAB NATION'S UNITY 
IN ALL FIELDS, ON ALL FRONTS, AND AT ALL BATTLES IN 
THE ENTIRE ARAB HOMELAND.  SIGNED: YOUR BROTHER, 
COLONEL MU'AMMAR AL-QADHAFI.  END TEXT.
